### StackOverflow

Hi, this is my repository of works done on behalf to questions answered
in SO.

This repository will be organized in submodules that represent the
individual answers to questions (they are so tagged) that I have
answered, providing some kind of software that is version
maintained.  This way, you can enjoin the complete program without
having to download the full collection.

For the moment, I have some houskeeping to do, as this organization
is something I've decided short ago.  It's possible that I change my
mind in the future, as parent projects tend to stick on specific
submodule versions, so it is neccessary to update in the aggregator
the versions in the submodules, as they are updated.  But this could
help to distinguish valid, stable versions from development ones.


Luis.
